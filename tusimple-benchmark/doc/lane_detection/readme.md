# TuSimple Lane Detection Challenge

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuSimple/tusimple-benchmark/master/doc/lane_detection/assets/examples/lane_example.jpg)

Objects on the road can be divided into two main groups: static objects and dynamic objects. Lane markings are the main static component on the highway. They instruct the vehicles to interactively and safely drive on the highway. To encourage people to solve the lane detection problem on highways, we are releasing about 7,000 one-second-long video clips of 20 frames each.   
 
Lane detection is a critical task in autonomous driving, which provides localization information to the control of the car. We provide video clips for this task, and the last frame of each clip contains labelled lanes. The video clip can help algorithms to infer better lane detection results. With clips, we expect competitors to come up with more efficient algorithms. For an autonomous driving vehicle, a time/memory-efficient algorithm means more resources for other algorithms and engineering pipelines. 
 
At the same time, we expect competitors to think about the semantic meaning of lanes for autonomous driving, rather than detecting every single lane marking on the road. Therefore, the annotations and testing are focused on the current and left/right lanes.
 
We will have a leaderboard showing the evaluation results for the submissions. We have prizes for the top-three competitors, and they will also be mentioned at the CVPR 2017 Workshop on Autonomous Driving Challenge.

## Dataset Details

### Directory Structure:
The directory structure for the training/testing dataset is following. We have a JSON file to instruct you how to use the data in `clips` directory.

    dataset
      |
      |----clips/                   # video clips
      |------|
      |------|----some_clip/        # Sequential images for the clip, 20 frames
      |------|----...
      |
      |----tasks.json               # Label data in training set, and a submission template for testing set. 

### Demo
The [demo code](https://github.com/TuSimple/tusimple-benchmark/blob/master/example/lane_demo.ipynb) shows the data
format of the lane dataset and the usage of the evaluation tool.

### Label Data Format
Each json line in 'label_data_(date).json' is the label data for __the last (20th) frame__ of this clip.

__Format__

```
    {
      'raw_file': str. 20th frame file path in a clip.
      'lanes': list. A list of lanes. For each list of one lane, the elements are width values on image.
      'h_samples': list. A list of height values corresponding to the 'lanes', which means len(h_samples) == len(lanes[i])
    }
```
Actually there will be at most 5 lane markings in `lanes`. We expect at most 4 lane markings (current lane and left/right lanes). The extra lane is used when changing lane because it is confused to tell which lane is the current lane.

The polylines are orgnized by the same distance gap ('h_sample' in each label data) from the recording car. It means you can pair each element in one lane and h_samples to get position of lane marking on images.

Also, the lanes are around the center of sight, which we encourage the autonomous driving vehicle to focus on the current lane and left/right lanes. These lanes are essential for the control of the car.

For example,
```
{
  "lanes": [
        [-2, -2, -2, -2, 632, 625, 617, 609, 601, 594, 586, 578, 570, 563, 555, 547, 539, 532, 524, 516, 508, 501, 493, 485, 477, 469, 462, 454, 446, 438, 431, 423, 415, 407, 400, 392, 384, 376, 369, 361, 353, 345, 338, 330, 322, 314, 307, 299],
        [-2, -2, -2, -2, 719, 734, 748, 762, 777, 791, 805, 820, 834, 848, 863, 877, 891, 906, 920, 934, 949, 963, 978, 992, 1006, 1021, 1035, 1049, 1064, 1078, 1092, 1107, 1121, 1135, 1150, 1164, 1178, 1193, 1207, 1221, 1236, 1250, 1265, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2],
        [-2, -2, -2, -2, -2, 532, 503, 474, 445, 416, 387, 358, 329, 300, 271, 241, 212, 183, 154, 125, 96, 67, 38, 9, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2],
        [-2, -2, -2, 781, 822, 862, 903, 944, 984, 1025, 1066, 1107, 1147, 1188, 1229, 1269, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2]
       ],
  "h_samples": [240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 450, 460, 470, 480, 490, 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620, 630, 640, 650, 660, 670, 680, 690, 700, 710],
  "raw_file": "path_to_clip"
}
```
`-2` in `lanes` means on some h_sample, there is no existing lane marking. The first existing point in the first lane is `(632, 280)`.


## Evaluation

For each prediction of a clip, please organize the result as the same format of label data.
Also, you need to output the `lanes` according to the `h_samples` in the `test_tasks.json` for evaluation. It means we are going to evaluate points on specific image heights.

__Format__

```
{
  'raw_file': str. 20th frame file path in a clip.
  'lanes': list. A list of lanes. For each list of one lane, there is only width index on the image.
  'run_time': list of float. The running time for each frame in the clip. The unit is millisecond.
}
```
Remember we expect at most 4/5 lane markings in `lanes` (current lane and left/right lanes). Feel free to output either a extra left or right lane marking when changing lane. We only accept that the number of submitted lanes is no larger than the number of ground-truth lanes plus 2. For example, if the number of lanes in the ground-truth for some image is 4 and you submit 7 lanes, the accuracy for this image is 0. So, please submit the most confident lanes. Besides, the maximum number of lanes in ground-truth is mostly 4, some are 5.

The evaluation formula is

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;$$accuracy&space;=&space;\frac{\sum_{clip}&space;C_{clip}}{\sum_{clip}&space;S_{clip}}$$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;$$accuracy&space;=&space;\frac{\sum_{clip}&space;C_{clip}}{\sum_{clip}&space;S_{clip}}$$" title="$$accuracy = \frac{\sum_{clip} C_{clip}}{\sum_{clip} S_{clip}}$$" /></a>

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;$C_{clip}$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;$C_{clip}$" title="$C_{clip}$" /></a> is the number of correct points in the last frame of the `clip`,
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;$S_{clip}$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;$S_{clip}$" title="$S_{clip}$" /></a> is the number of requested points in the last frame of the `clip`. If the difference between the width of ground-truth and prediction is less than a threshold, the predicted point is a correct one. If you some point is out of view or there is no lane markings of some specific `h_sample`, just record the detection as `-2`. We will evaluate the values of all heights in `h_sample`.

Based on the formula above, we will also compute the rate of false positive and false negative for your test results. False positive means the lane is predicted but not matched with any lane in ground-truth. False negative means the lane is in the ground-truth but not matched with any lane in the prediction.

We also request the running time from your algorithm. We do not rank by running time. However, algorithms that are too slow (like less than 5 fps using single GPU) will be considered as no predicted lanes. 

### Prizes

The prizes for the winners are following. Please review the [rules](http://benchmark.tusimple.ai/#/term) for terms and conditions to receive a prize.

1. First place prize: $ 1000
2. Second place prize: $ 500
3. Third place prize: $ 250 

We rank only by the `accuracy` we methioned above. `FP` and `FN` help competitors to improve their algorithm.
